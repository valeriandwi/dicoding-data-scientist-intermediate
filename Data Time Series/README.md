## Introduction

A time series is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at successive and equally spaced intervals of time. These data points can represent any kind of metric, such as temperature, stock prices, sales figures, or web traffic, among others. Time series data is used to analyze trends, patterns, and behaviors over time, making it a crucial component in various fields including finance, economics, environmental science, and more.
